How to use Bnoerj.Audio:

First off all, you need the March 2008 release of the DirectX SDK to get the
XACT3 tools.

To use Bnoerj.Audio in your Windows XNA Game Studio game the only code changes
are:

1. Reference the Bnoerj.Audio.dll assembly
2. Replace all using Microsoft.XNA.Framework.Audio with using Bnoerj.Audio

The xap file(s) in your project need to be edited in XACT3.exe to add WMA
compression for the Windows target. Once the compression preset(s) have been
updated you might want to save the xap file using a different name (e.g.
MyProject.xap3) to not break the build of your Xbox 360 project. To generate
the runtime xgs, xsb and xwb files you can either use the XACT3 GUI or the
command line tool xact3bld.exe, e.g. "XactBld3.exe /L X:HEADER /WINDOWS
MyProject.xap3 ." (without the quotes) to build the binaries into the current
directory (ignoring the output directories defined in the xap file itself).
The binaries can than be used inside the games content project instead of the
xap file.
